# MushroomClassPredictionUsingNaiveBasyes
## The mushroom classification problem refers to the task of classifying mushrooms into different categories based on their attributes or features. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the edibility or toxicity of a given mushroom based on its characteristics.
## In this problem, mushrooms are typically described by various features such as cap shape, cap color, gill size, odor, etc. These features can be categorical or numerical. The target variable is the class label indicating whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.
## The challenge in mushroom classification lies in identifying the distinguishing features that can accurately differentiate between edible and poisonous mushrooms. Machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM) are commonly used to solve this problem.
## It's important to note that working with mushrooms can involve safety risks, as some mushrooms can be highly toxic. Therefore, if you are handling real mushroom data, it is crucial to consult with experts or use curated datasets to ensure your analysis is safe and accurate.
## I have used the dataset from kuggele which is availabe on google -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification
## I am using here to classification of the mushroom is Naive Bayes algorithm.->Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm based on the Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between the features. It is commonly used for classification tasks and is known for its simplicity and efficiency.
## The steps to build the classifier -
### 1.Encode the Categorical data into Numerical Data
### 2.Break the datda into train and test
### 3.making the prior probabilty
### 4.making the funciton to predict the conditional probability
### 5.building the classifier
### 6.chaking the Score 
## our model is giving the 0.9969230769230769 score.
